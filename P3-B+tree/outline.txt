The test cases are in the main function


test4: line 206
	Goal: Test for the large number
	Implement: Set the size of the relationship to be 50000
	This is to test whether the database can handle a large amount of data and find the data correctly.

test5: line 218
	Goal: Test for the small number
	Implement: Set the size of the relationship to be 10, and the search 	
	This is to test whether the database can handle a small amount of data and find the data correctly. In this situation, the level should only be one, and the root node is also the leaf node.

test6: line 227
	Goal: Test reuse of the index file
	Implement: First you generate a relation file, and you don't delete it after finishing the operation. Then you can reuse it.
	This is to handle the situation that there is already a index file, and you should read it correctly.

test7: line 237
	Goal: Test the search edge, where the outcome is 0
	checkPassFail(intScan(&index,5,GT,6,LT), 0)
	Implement: set checkPassFail(intScan(&index,5,GT,6,LT), 0), which is a valid scale but nor return the outcome
	This is designed to handle the edge condition

test8: line 248
	Goal: Search the whole scale to determine whether leafnode of b+tree can be 		visited one by one correctly(Read the data across the pages)
	Implement  	checkPassFail(intScan(&index,0,GTE,4999,LTE), 5000)
	This is designed to handle the last element

Test9: line 286
	Goal: Use small size of buffer pool to detect "unpin"
	Implement: Set the buffer to be small, and read two level index tree.
